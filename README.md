# Predictive Maintenance Using Machine Learning

## Overview
Predictive maintenance leverages machine learning to forecast potential equipment failures before they occur. This project utilizes **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks** along with other ML techniques to predict maintenance needs based on sensor data, reducing downtime and optimizing operational efficiency.

## Features
- **Time-series forecasting** using **LSTM networks** to predict equipment failures.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with visualizations to identify trends and correlations.
- **Feature engineering** to extract meaningful insights from raw sensor data.
- **Model evaluation** using RMSE, MAE, and accuracy metrics.

## Data Processing
The dataset consists of sensor readings from industrial equipment. The key steps in data processing include:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and outliers.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Creating lag variables, rolling statistics, and normalized inputs.
3. **Train-Test Split:** Dividing data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks
LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to process sequential data effectively. They maintain memory across time steps, making them suitable for predictive maintenance tasks where historical sensor readings influence future states.

### Why LSTM for Predictive Maintenance?
- Can capture **long-term dependencies** in time-series data.
- Handles **irregular time gaps** between equipment failures.
- Reduces **false positives** by learning complex patterns in sensor behavior.

## Model Performance
The project evaluates model performance using various metrics:
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Measures prediction accuracy.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Quantifies prediction deviations.
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct maintenance predictions.

## How to Run the Project
### Prerequisites
Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow keras scikit-learn
```

### Running the Model
Execute the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model:
```bash
jupyter notebook Predictive_Maintenance_using_Machine_Learning.ipynb
```

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate **real-time streaming data** for dynamic predictions.
- Implement **hybrid models** combining LSTM with anomaly detection.
- Deploy as a **REST API** for easy integration into industrial applications.
